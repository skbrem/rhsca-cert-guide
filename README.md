A personal guide for my studies toward earning the RHCSA.

Going to draw in info from as many different sources as possible, and will likely document the process of setting up my own homelab and going through all the different RHCSA-related processes.

Although the structure and formatting will be similar to the source material, everything is handwritten by me.
